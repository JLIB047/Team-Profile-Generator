# Team-Profile-Generator

## Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to generate an HTML page by answering prompts via the command line.  This project tested our skills in node js, test driven development and object oriented programming.  I created tests for my javascript functions to make sure they worked before being used in my application.  I used fs and inquirer to prompt the user through a series of questions to generate an HTML page.  Once the prompts are answered a Html page is generated and reflects all of the given information.
